toggle
    A clickable HTML entity that will serve to Start and Stop the workshift
    timer.

startURI
    An optional URI that if specified will be expected to create and return a 
    workshift when the toggle entity is clicked.

stopURI
    An optional URI that if specified will receive the stop time of a workshift.
totalHour
    A DOM element that jsWorkshift will populate with the workshift sum.

rowTemplate
    Optional jQuery tmpl script that allows custom rendering of a workshift row.
additionalDateRenderer
    Optional callback that accepts a workshift object and returns a new DOM
    element to insert after the date element for each workshift day.
